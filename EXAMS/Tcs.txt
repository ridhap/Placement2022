TCS is one of the largest software company in the world. I got a job at TCS in college campus. I feel very happy for this. I know everybody become tensed when he/she appear his/her first interview. I also felt nervous. In my opinion there are some steps to crack TCS selection process. For TCS selection a very important link is #nextstep.#tcs.#com/campus/.

Please note that all subjects mentioned on the mark sheets should be taken into consideration while calculating the aggregate marks. For example, best of 5/6 subjects for calculating the aggregate is not acceptable as per the TCSL Eligibility Criteria. All subjects mentioned on the mark sheet (including languages, optional subjects etc) should be taken into consideration for calculating obtained/total marks/CGPA.
2) First attempt implies that you should pass the final year/semester examination (Xth, XIIh, Diploma, Graduation and Post-Graduation as applicable) with minimum aggregate (aggregate of all subjects in all semesters) marks of 60% and above within the normal duration of the course itself. For example, if you have secured 58.9 % (aggregate of all subjects) in your Standard XIIth examination in the first attempt and you have taken an improvement exam in the next attempt securing 62 %, you do not fulfill the TCSL eligibility criteria as marks/CGPA obtained during the normal duration of the course only will be considered.

Sample Answer:
Dear Mr. ABC,
The project “Payment processing system” was scheduled to be delivered on 10th May (Friday). However, due to an unexpected power outage in our offshore site for the past 3 days, work did not progress as expected. Also we lost a few of our works as backup systems did not come online. Hence we are expecting an overall delay in the delivery of the project for a maximum of 7 days within which our team will work on the issues. Apologies for the delay and we will ensure that the mistake will not recur in future again.
